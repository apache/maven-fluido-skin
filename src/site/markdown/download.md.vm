# Download ${project.name} ${project.version} Source

${project.name} ${project.version} is distributed in source format\. Use a source archive if you intend to build
${project.name} yourself\. Otherwise, simply use the ready\-made binary artifacts from central repository\.

You will be prompted for a mirror \- if the file is not found on yours, please be patient, as it may take 24
hours to reach all mirrors\.

In order to guard against corrupted downloads/installations, it is highly recommended to
[verify the signature](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#verifying-signature)
of the release bundles against the public [KEYS](https://www.apache.org/dist/maven/KEYS) used by the Apache Maven
developers\.

${project.name} is distributed under the [Apache License, version 2\.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/)\.

We **strongly** encourage our users to configure a Maven repository mirror closer to their location, please read [How to Use Mirrors for Repositories](./guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html)\.
